This was made to help a fourth year display their artwork and animations, as a result it's between two styles. I used this to experiment with game feel and work on creating fluent camera controls for a 2D platformer shooter. The camera adjusts depending on the player's Y position, whether they're shooting, what direction they're moving, etc. 

To help with the project I also ensured the inspector was very easy to use. Creating an editor tool that could be used to paint tiles while dynamically assigning sprites and placing A* nodes above open tiles. This was done with an older version of Unity before Tilemaps, however this still holds the advantage over Unity's TileMap of placing full gameobjects with components. Please refer to the screenshots for the inspector view, and the video for a view of the tool.

A lot of stuff needs to be rebalanced in this current build, for example the screen shake is too intense and controls are floaty.
